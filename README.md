# Lab C03 Group (2020-21)

This repo is made to hold all the code and data generated by lab experiments.

## Usage

This repo should be manteined up-to-date with latest experiments and data.

## Stat Library

`stat` is a `C++` library made exclusevely to compute statistical average and standard error.
It is located in `stat/stat.h`.

***Library Usage***

`stat::read_values()` takes a `stdin::vector` as input, whereas the vector contain all data needed in calculation.

`stat::avg()` return average of elements in the `vector`.
`stat::std_err()` return standard error computed from RMS (Root Minimimum Square).

`stat::clear()` is needed to clean up the data vector, in order to compute other data.
